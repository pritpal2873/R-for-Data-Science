Covariation describes the behavior between variables. Covariations is the tendency for the values of two or more variables to vary together in a related way. The best way to spot covariation is to visualize the relationship between two or more variables.

### A Categorical and Continuous Variable

It's common to want to explore the distribution of a continuous variable broken down by a categorical variable, as in the previous frequency polygon. The default appearance of `geom_freqpoly()` is not useful for that sort of comparison because the height is given by the count. That means if one of the groups is much smaller than the others, it's hard to see the differences in shape. For example, let's explore how the price of a diamond varies with its quality.

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = price)) +
  geom_freqpoly(mapping = aes(color = cut), binwidth = 500)
```

It's hard to see the difference in distribution because the overall counts differ so much.

```{r}
ggplot(diamonds) + 
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut))
```

To make the comparison easier we need to swap what is displayed on the y-axis. Instead of displaying count, we will display *density*, which is the count standardized so that the area under each frequency polygon is one.

```{r}
ggplot(
  data = diamonds,
  mapping = aes(x = price, y = after_stat(density))
) + 
  geom_freqpoly(mapping = aes(color = cut), binwidth = 500)
```

There's something rather surprising about this plot - it appears that fair diamonds (the lowest quality) have the highest average price! But may be that's because frequency polygons are a little hard to interpret - there's a lot going on in this plot.

Another alternative to display the distribution of a continuous variable broken down by a categorical variable is the boxplot. A *boxplot* is a type of visual shorthand for a distribution of values that is popular among statisticians. Each boxplot consists of

-   A box that stretches from the 25th percentile of the distribution to the 75th percentile, a distance known as the interquartile range (IRQ). In the middle of the box is a line that displays the median, i.e., 50th percentile, of the distribution. These three line gives us a sense of the spread of the distribution is symmetric about the median or skewed to one side.

-   Visual points that display observations that fall more than 1.5 times the IRQ from either edge of the box. These outlying points are unusual, so they are plotted individually.

-   A line (or whisker) that extends from each end of the box and goes to the farthest nonoutlier point in the distribution.

Let's take a look at the distribution of price by cut using `geom_boxplot()`

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = cut, y = price)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

We see much less information about the distribution, but the boxplots are much more compact so we can more easily compare them and fit more on one plot. It supports the counter-intuitive finding that better quality diamonds are cheaper on average!

`cut` is an ordered factor: fair is worse than good, which is worse then very good, and so on. Many categorical variables do not have such an intrinsic order, so we might want to reorder them to make a more informative display. One way to do that is with the `reorder()` function.

For example, take the `class` variable in the `mpg` dataset. We might be interested to know how highway mileage varies across classes.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = class, y = hwy)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

To make the trend easier to see, we can reorder `class` based in the median value of `hwy`

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_boxplot(
    mapping = aes(
      x = reorder(class, hwy, FUN = median),
      y = hwy
    )
  )
```

If we have long variables names, `geom_boxplot()` will work between if we flip it 90 degree. We can do that with `coord_flip()`

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_boxplot(
    mapping = aes(
      x = reorder(class, hwy, FUN = median),
      y = hwy
    )
  ) + 
  coord_flip()
```

### Two Categorical Variables

To visualize the covariation between categorical variables, we will need to count the number of observations for each combination. One way to do that is to rely on the built-in `geom_count()`

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_count(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = color))
```

The size of the each circle in the plot displays how many observations occurred at each combination of values. Covariation will appear as strong correlation between specific `x` values and specific `y` values.

Another approach is to compute the count with `dplyr`

```{r}
diamonds %>%
  count(color, cut)
```

Then visualize with `geom_title()` and fill aesthetic

```{r}
diamonds %>%
  count(color, cut) %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = color, y = cut)) + 
  geom_tile(mapping = aes(fill = n))
```

\
If the categorical variables are unordered, we might want to use the **seriation** package to simultaneously reorder the rows and columns in order to more clearly reveal interesting patterns. For larger plots, we might want to try the **d3heatmap** or **heatmaply** packages which creates interactive plots.

### Two Continuous Variables

We have already seen one great way to visualize the covariation between two continuous variables; draw a scatterplot with `geom_point()`. We can see covariation as pattern in the points. For example, we can see exponential relationship between the carat size and price of a diamond

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = carat, y =price))
```

Scatterplots becomes less useful as the size of our dataset grows, because points begins to over-plot and pile up into areas of uniform black. We have already seen one way to fix the problem, using `alpha` aesthetic to add transparency.

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_point(
    mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price),
    alpha = 1 / 100
  )
```

But using transparency can be challenging for very large datasets. Another solution is to use bin. Previously we used `geom_histogram()` and `geom_freqply()` to bin in one dimension. Now we will learn how to use `geom_bin2d()` and `geom_hex()` to bin in two dimensions.

`geom_bin2d()` and `geom_hex()` divide the coordinate plane into 2D bins and then use a fill color to display how many points fall into each bin. `geom_bin2d()` creates rectangular bins. `geom_hex()` creates hexagonal bins. We will need to install the **hexbin** package to use `geom_hex()`.

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) + 
  geom_bin2d(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price))
```

```{r}
#install.packages("hexbin")
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_hex(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price))

```

Another options is to bin one continuous variable so it acts like a categorical variable. Then we can use one of the techniques for visualizing the combination of a categorical and a continuous variable that we learned about. For example, we could bin `carat` and then for each group, display a boxplot.

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price)) + 
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(group = cut_width(carat, 0.1)))
```

`cut_width(x, width)`, as used here, divides x into bins of width `width`, by default, boxplots look roughly the same regardless of how many observations there are so it's difficult to tell that each boxplot summarizes a different number of points. One way to show that is to make the width of the boxplot proportional to the number of points with `varwidth = TRUE`.

Another approach is to display approximately the same number of points in each bin. That's the job of `cut_number()`

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(group = cut_number(carat, 20)))
```
